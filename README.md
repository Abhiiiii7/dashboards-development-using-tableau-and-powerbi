## Projects (Many more are in queue)
#### 1. Yes Bank Stock Analytics
This dashboard visualization was based on Yes Bank stock market data. In this dashboard we have used the old and current data upto 2019 to analyze and predict the trend of yes bank stock analysis. 



#### 2. McdonaldSchaefer Campaign Dashboard
This dashboard visualization was based on Capital campaign. In this dashboard we have used the 3rd party api(quickbase) to get the realtime data and the dashboard that we designed was the collection of the record of donors on how much fund are they raising and collecting throughout different campaigns.
